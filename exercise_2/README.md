This assignment revolves around:

- understand **Neural Networks** and how they are arranged in layered architectures
- understand and be able to implement (vectorized) **backpropagation**
- implement various **update rules** used to optimize Neural Networks
- implement **batch normalization** for training deep networks

<br />

### 1_FullyConnectedNets.ipynb 
The IPython notebook `FullyConnectedNets.ipynb` introduces modular layer design, and then uses those layers to implement fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth. To optimize these models several popular update rules are also implemented.

### 2_BatchNormalization-optional.ipynb 
In the IPython notebook `BatchNormalization.ipynb` batch normalization is implemented and is used to train deep fully-connected networks.
